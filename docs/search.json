Entrants are asked to choose a set of 6 faces from photographs that they find “most beautiful”. Those who picked the most popular face are eligible for a prize.\nA naive strategy would be to choose the 6 faces that, in the opinion of the entrant, are most beautiful. A more sophisticated contest entrant, wishing to maximize the chances of winning against naive opponents, would guess which faces the majority finds attractive, and then make a selection based on this inference.\nThis can be carried one step further to account for the fact that other entrants would each have their own opinions of what public perceptions of beauty are. What does everyone believe about what everyone else believes about whom others find attractive?\n\n\nThe Beauty Contest and the Stock Market\n\nIt is not a case of choosing those faces that, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those that average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.\nJohn Maynard Keynes,\nGeneral Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, 1936\n\nKeynes suggested that similar behavior is observed in the stock market. Shares are not priced based on what people think their fundamental value is, but rather on what they think everyone else thinks the value is and what they think about these beliefs, and so on.",

Such beliefs represent a player’s uncertainty about his opponents’ actions, not necessarily his theory about their deliberate randomization and coordination.\nPlayer i may place equal probability on two scenarios: either both j and k pick action A or they both play B. If i is not sure which theory is true, then his beliefs are correlated even though he knows that j and k are acting independently.\n\nDefinition 1.3 (Best Responses) A strategy \\sigma_{i} \\in S_{i} is a best response to a belief \\sigma_{-i} \\in \\Delta\\left(S_{-i}\\right) if\n\nu_{i}\\left(\\sigma_{i}, \\sigma_{-i}\\right) \\geq u_{i}\\left(s_{i}, \\sigma_{-i}\\right), \\forall s_{i} \\in S_{i}\n\n\n\n\nRationalizabile Strategies\nCommon knowledge of payoffs and rationality imposes restrictions on play…\n\nDefinition 1.4 Set S^{0}=S and let S^{k} be given recursively by\n\nS_{i}^{k}=\\left\\{s_{i} \\in S_{i}^{k-1} \\mid \\exists \\sigma_{-i} \\in \\Delta\\left(S_{-i}^{k-1}\\right), u_{i}\\left(s_{i}, \\sigma_{-i}\\right) \\geq u_{i}\\left(s_{i}^{\\prime}, \\sigma_{-i}\\right), \\forall s_{i}^{\\prime} \\in S_{i}^{k-1}\\right\\}\n\nThe set of correlated rationalizable strategies for player i is S_{i}^{\\infty}=\\bigcap_{k \\geq 0} S_{i}^{k}.

If s_{i} were not a best response within S_{i} to \\sigma_{-i}, let s_{i}^{\\prime} be a best response.\nSince s_{i} is a best response within S_{i}^{k-1} to \\sigma_{-i} and s_{i}^{\\prime} is a better response than s_{i} to \\sigma_{-i}, we need s_{i}^{\\prime} \\notin S_{i}^{k-1}.\nThen s_{i}^{\\prime} was deleted at an earlier stage, say s_{i}^{\\prime} \\in S_{i}^{l-1} but s_{i}^{\\prime} \\notin S_{i}^{\\prime} for some I \\leq k-1.

Suppose that there exists Z_{1} \\times \\ldots \\times Z_{n} \\not \\subset S^{\\infty} that is closed under rational behavior.\nConsider the smallest k for which there is an i such that Z_{i} \\not \\subset S_{i}^{k}. It must be that k \\geq 1 and Z_{-i} \\subseteq S_{-i}^{k-1}.\nBy assumption, every element of Z_{i} is a best response to an element of \\Delta\\left(Z_{-i}\\right) \\subset \\Delta\\left(S_{-i}^{k-1}\\right), contradicting Z_{i} \\nsubseteq S_{i}^{k}.\n\n\n\n\nEpistemic Foundations of Rationalizability\nFormalize the idea of common knowledge and show that rationalizability captures the idea of common knowledge of rationality (and payoffs).\n\nDefinition 1.6 (Information Structure) An information (or belief) structure is a list \\left(\\Omega,\\left(l_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N},\\left(p_{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}\\right)\n\n\\Omega is a finite state space\nl_{i}: \\Omega \\rightarrow 2^{\\Omega} is a partition of \\Omega for each i \\in N s.t. l_{i}(\\omega) is the set of states that i thinks are possible when the true state is \\omega; \\omega^{\\prime} \\in l_{i}(\\omega) \\Leftrightarrow \\omega \\in l_{i}\\left(\\omega^{\\prime}\\right)\np_{i, l_{i}(\\omega)} \\in \\Delta\\left(l_{i}(\\omega)\\right): i^{\\prime} ’s belief at \\omega\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation\n\nState \\omega summarizes all the relevant facts about the world. Only one of the states is true; all others are hypothetical states needed to encode players’ beliefs.\nIn state \\omega, player i is informed that the state is in l_{i}(\\omega) and gets no other information.\nSuch an information structure arises if each player observes a state-dependent signal and l_{i}(\\omega) is the set of states for which player i ’s signal is identical to the signal at \\omega.\n\n\n\nKnowledge and Common Knowledge\n\nFor any event F \\subseteq \\Omega, player i knows at \\omega that F obtains if l_{i}(\\omega) \\subseteq F.

    "text": "1.26 EQUILIBRIUM POINTS IN N-PERSON GAMES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\n\n\nAny n-tuple of strategies, one for each player, may be regarded as a point in the product space obtained by multiplying the n strategy spaces of the players. One such n-tuple counters another if the strategy of each player in the countering n-tuple yields the highest obtainable expectation for its player against the n-1 strategies of the other players in the countered n-tuple. A self-countering n-tuple is called an equilibrium point.\nThe correspondence of each n-tuple with its set of countering n-tuples gives a one-to-many mapping of the product space into itself. From the definition of countering we see that the set of countering points of a point is convex. By using the continuity of the pay-off functions we see that the graph of the mapping is closed. The closedness is equivalent to saying: if P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots and Q_{1}, Q_{2}, \\ldots, Q_{n}, \\ldots are sequences of points in the product space where Q_{n} \\rightarrow Q, P_{n} \\rightarrow P and Q_{n} counters P_{n} then Q counters P.\nSince the graph is closed and since the image of each point under the mapping is convex, we infer from Kakutani’s theorem { }^{1} that the mapping has a fixed point (i.e., point contained in its image). Hence there is an equilibrium point.\nIn the two-person zero-sum case the “main theorem” 2 and the existence of an equilibrium point are equivalent. In this case any two equilibrium points lead to the same expectations for the players, but this need not occur in general.\n\nThe author is indebted to Dr. David Gale for suggesting the use of Kakutani’s theorem to simplify the proof and to the A. E. C. for financial support.\n\n{ }^{1} Kakutani, S., Duke Math. J., 8, 457-459 (1941).\nCourtesy of John F.

A more sophisticated contest entrant, wishing to maximize the chances of winning against naive opponents, would guess which faces the majority finds attractive, and then make a selection based on this inference.\nThis can be carried one step further to account for the fact that other entrants would each have their own opinions of what public perceptions of beauty are.

    "text": "1.6 Nash Equilibrium\nMany games are not dominance solvable. Nevertheless, the involved parties find a solution.\n\n\n\nCoordination Game, Battle of the Sexes, Matching Pennies\n\n\nA Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile with the property that no player can benefit by deviating from his corresponding strategy.\n\nDefinition 1.8 (Nash 1950) A mixed-strategy profile \\sigma^{*} is a Nash equilibrium if for every i \\in N,\n\nu_{i}\\left(\\sigma_{i}^{*}, \\sigma_{-i}^{*}\\right) \\geq u_{i}\\left(s_{i}, \\sigma_{-i}^{*}\\right), \\forall s_{i} \\in S_{i}\n\n\n\nRemarks\n\nThe fact that there is no profitable deviation in pure strategies implies there is no profitable deviation in mixed strategies either.\nIf in equilibrium a player uses a mixed strategy that places positive probability on several pure strategies, he must be indifferent between all pure strategies in its support.\nStrategies that do not survive iterated strict dominance (or are not rationalizable) cannot be played with positive probability in a Nash equilibrium.\n\n\n\nWhat Are the Assumptions?\n\nNash equilibria are “consistent” predictions (or “stable” conventions) of how the game will be played.\nIf all players expect that a specific Nash equilibrium will arise, then no player has incentives to play differently.\nEach player must have correct conjectures about the strategies of his opponents and play a best response to his conjecture.\nWe interpret mixed strategies as beliefs regarding opponents’ play, not necessarily as deliberate randomization.\nAssumes knowledge of strategies (beliefs) and rationality.\n\n\n\nDo Soccer Players Flip Coins?\nPenalty kicks\n\nKicker’s strategy space: \\{L, M, R\\}\nGoalie’s strategy space: \\{L, M, R\\}\n\nWhat are the payoffs?\n\nWhat’s the Nash equilibrium?\nSimultaneous move game?

Unique mixed strategy equilibrium, which puts positive probability only on strategies C and B for either player.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor player 1 , playing C with probability \\epsilon and B with probability 1-\\epsilon \\mathrm{s}. dominates F.\nIf player 1 never chooses F, then C s. dominates F for player 2 .\nIn the remaining 2 \\times 2 game, there is a unique equilibrium, in which both players place probability 1 / 4 on C and 3 / 4 on B.\n\n\n\nStag Hunt\nEach player can choose to hunt hare by himself or hunt stag with the other. Stag offers a higher payoff, but only if players team up.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria – (S, S) and (H, H) – and a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium – (7 / 8 S+1 / 8 H, 7 / 8 S+1 / 8 H).\n\n\nWhich Equilibrium is More Plausible?\n\nWe may expect (S, S) to be played because it is Pareto dominant. However, if one player expects the other to hunt hare, he is much better off hunting hare himself; and the potential downside of choosing stag is bigger than the upside-hare is the safer choice.\nHarsanyi and Selten (1988): H is the risk-dominant action-if each player expects the other to choose either action with probability 1 / 2, then H has a higher expected payoff (7.5) than S (4.5).\nFor a player to optimally choose stag, he should expect the other to play stag with probability \\geq 7 / 8.\nCoordination problem may persist even if players communicate: regardless of what i intends to do, he would prefer j to play stag, so attempts to convince j to play stag are cheap talk.\n\n\n\nEpistemic Foundations\n\nAumann and Brandenburger (1995): a framework that can be used to examine the epistemic foundations of Nash equilibrium.\nThe primitive of their model is an interactive belief system in which there is a possible set of types for each player; each type has associated to it a payoff for every action profile, a choice of which action to play, and a belief about the types of the other players.\nIn a 2-player game, if the game being played, the rationality of the players, and their conjectures are all mutually known, then the conjectures constitute a Nash equilibrium.\nFor games with more than 2 players, we need to assume additionally that players have a common prior and that conjectures are commonly known. This ensures that any two players have identical and separable (independent) conjectures about other players, consistent with a mixed strategy profile.\n\n\n\nEvolutionary Foundations\n\nSolution concepts motivated by presuming that players make predictions about their opponents’ play by introspection and deduction, using knowledge of their opponents’ payoffs, rationality…\nAlternatively, assume players extrapolate from past observations of play in “similar” games and best respond to expectations based on past observations.\nCournot (1838) suggested that players take turns setting their outputs in the duopoly game, best responding to the opponent’s last-period action.\nSimultaneous action updating, best responding to average play, populations of players anonymously matched (another way to think about mixed strategies), etc.\nIf the process converges to a particular steady state, then the steady state is a Nash equilibrium.\n\n\n\nConvergence\nHow sensitive is the convergence to the initial state? If convergence obtains for all initial strategy profiles sufficiently close to the steady state, we say that the steady state is asymptotically stable.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of The MIT Press. Used with permission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShapley (1964) Cycling\n\n\n\n\nRemarks\n\nEvolutionary processes are myopic and do not offer a compelling description of behavior.\nSuch processes do not provide good predictions for behavior in the actual repeated game, if players care about play in future periods and realize that their current actions can affect opponents’ future play.",
